    	<h2>Overview</h2>
    	<p>We believe in honoring life and land with dignified green burials. Duck Run Natural Cemetery is committed to doing no harm to the environment when burials take place. Our requirements stipulate no toxins or non-biodegradable materials are used during the burial or on top of the grave. We offer memorial grave markers from native fieldstones and families may purchase native Virginia flowers and plants to contribute in memoriam to the master plan of the cemetery.</p>
